# RecyclerViewExtensions

`RecyclerViewExtensions` is a collection of self-contained and reusable extensions for `RecyclerView`.

Out of the box, `ListView` provides functionality that is absent from `RecyclerView`. This work started in support of a transition from the former to the later, and grew over time.

## Extensions

There are multiple extensions to pick from. See each module's README for details:

* [Animations](Animations)
* [ClickListeners](ClickListeners)
* [Dividers](Dividers)
* [DragDrop](DragDrop)
* [Flippers](Flippers)
* [PinchZoom](PinchZoom)
* [Selectors](Selectors)
* [StickyHeaders](StickyHeaders)
